# Smart Greenhouse

This app will help you in managing your plants efficiently from wherever and whenever.
You can choose to let the app handle all the work for you and/or you can manually check the temperature, humidity and light status of your plants.

Too hot for the plant? Start the fan by the press of a button.
Plant needs water? Start the pump and continue enjoying your cup of coffee at your favourite coffee shop.

By the use of a python backend, a flask server, a raspberry pi and a react native mobile app, your plants will be as low maintenance as possible. Enjoy having plants without the effort of having plants!
